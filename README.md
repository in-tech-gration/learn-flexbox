## Let's learn some CSS Flexbox properties

## Todo

  - Integrate: https://pjmazenot.github.io/steps.js/

  - Add all Flexbox properties, categorized under Parent and Child 

  - Add Skip to next exercise button

  - Exercises can contain custom (general) CSS, e.g. `* { box-sizing: border-box; }`

  - Warn about missing `#visual-blocks` and `#expected` classes on exercise parent elements

  - Exercises should contain extra CSS for the blocks, e.g. `aspect-ratio: 1/1`

  - Display applied styles as `<code>`

  - Make sure that rules can be disabled in the left panel by clicking them

  - Switch to a different music theme (mixkit-games-worldbeat-466.mp3)

  - Implement a loading indicator (images, sound, etc.)

  - Track Levels via global state

  - Implement NEWBIE (BABY) LEVEL 1: Disable flex container rules unless flex or inline-flex are dragged (gray-out non active flexbox rules if NO flexbox!)

  - NEWBIE (BABY) LEVEL 1: Show required colors in the target!

  - WARN NEWBIES ABOUT unnecessary rules, e.g. `flex-wrap`, when only `display: flex` is needed

  - WARN NEWBIES ABOUT `display:flex|inline-flex` required for rest of props
